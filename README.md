# Tessellation puzzles with holes.

## Introduction

This library contains code for randomly generating puzzles with multiple
solutions.

## Dependencies

```
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage

Go to the `square_grid` directory and run `$ python squre_5x5.py`.

## To-Do

1. Specify image in an arrangement (and interpolate to assign piece pixels).
2. Figure out how to prevent multiple unintended solutions.
3. Prevent wibbles from self-intersecting.
4. Consider adding some pressure to prevent the piece from collapsing when
   snapping together.
